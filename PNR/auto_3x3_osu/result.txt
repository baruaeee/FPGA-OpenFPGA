WARNING (IMPFP-7236): DIE's corner: (1580.7950000000 , 1543.6650000000) is NOT on PlacementGrid,  Please use command getFPlanMode to check current Grid settings, use command setFPlanMode to change which grid to snap to. And use command get_snap_grid_info to get grids' offset and pitch. Command floorplan can be used to fix this issue.
WARNING (IMPFP-7238): CORE's  corner:	(470.6400000000 , 470.6700000000)  is	NOT on PlacementGrid. You can use the getFPlanMode command to check the current grid settings and use the setFPlanMode command to  change the grid to snap to. You can also use the get_snap_grid_info command to get information on the offset and pitch of the current snap grid. To resolve this issue, use the floorPlan command.
