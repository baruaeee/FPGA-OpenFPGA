Info    : Created nominal operating condition. [LBR-412]
        : Operating condition '_nominal_' was created for the PVT values (1.000000, 1.800000, 25.000000) in library 'sky130_tt_1.8_25_nldm.lib'.
        : The nominal operating condition is represented, either by the nominal PVT values specified in the library source (via nom_process,nom_voltage and nom_temperature respectively), or by the default PVT values (1.0,1.0,1.0).
Warning : Unusable clock gating integrated cell found at the time of loading libraries. This warning happens because a particular library cell is defined as 'clock_gating_integrated_cell', but 'dont_use' attribute is defined as true in the liberty library. To make Genus use this cell for clock gating insertion, 'dont_use' attribute should be set to false. [LBR-101]
        : Clock gating integrated cell name: 'ICGX1'
        : To make the cell usable, change the value of 'dont_use' attribute to false.

        : Run check_design to check 'Undriven Port(s)/Pin(s)' section for all undriven module input ports. It is better to double confirm with designer if these undriven ports are expected. During syn_gen the undriven ports are controlled by attribute 'hdl_unconnected_value', the default value is 0.
