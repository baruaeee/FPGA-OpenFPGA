Info: Cellview Rev Num:99,  Tech Rev Num:59

WARNING (XSTRM-75): Target library 'FPGA_TOP' is attached to the technology library 'sky130_fd_pr_main'. Therefore, the technology file is opened in read-only mode. All the undefined layer-purpose pairs will be dropped.
WARNING (XSTRM-107): Existing cells in the target library will be overwritten if the cell names in the Stream file and the target library are the same. To prevent this, set the '-writeMode' option to 'noOverwrite'.
INFO (XSTRM-217): Reading the layer map file, /mnt/cae_storage_sw/eda/cadence/pdks/sky130/sky130_release_004a/libs/sky130_fd_pr_main/sky130_fd_pr_main.layermap
INFO (XSTRM-69): All the libraries specified in 'cds.lib' will be considered as reference libraries. This is because '-refLibList' option is specified as "XST_CDS_LIB".
WARNING (XSTRM-333): The '-enableColoring' option will be ignored during XStream In. This is because there is no color entry in the layer map and the object map file.
INFO (XSTRM-163): You have not used the '-viaMap' option. If a viaMap file, corresponding technology file or technology library exist, then use the '-viaMap' option for creating oaVia instances in the Streamed-In library. Using the '-viaMap' option improves performance and VM usage of applications using the Streamed-In design.

Summary of Options:

INFO (XSTRM-80075): Via detection cannot use a stdViaDef for "fpga_top_VIA11" due to rounding errors. A customViaDef has been used instead. Use the -dbuPerUU option to increase the DBUperUU to enable detection of stdViaDef.
INFO (XSTRM-81000): Via detection cannot create new via definition for "fpga_top_VIA11" because the technology database is not writable. The candidate via cell will be mapped to regular cell and the references to it instances.
INFO (XSTRM-80075): Via detection cannot use a stdViaDef for "fpga_top_VIA12" due to rounding errors. A customViaDef has been used instead. Use the -dbuPerUU option to increase the DBUperUU to enable detection of stdViaDef.
INFO (XSTRM-81000): Via detection cannot create new via definition for "fpga_top_VIA12" because the technology database is not writable. The candidate via cell will be mapped to regular cell and the references to it instances.
INFO (XSTRM-287): The STRUCTURE 'CLKBUFX8' in the input GDSII/Stream file will not be translated.
